# Light Forest - Custom Dark Forest Arena Rounds

Light Forest is the simplest way to create a custom branded [Dark Forest Arena](https://medium.com/dfdao/dark-forest-arena-14c47bfd4e8) round for your own community. It creates a website and game client for you automatically so you can focus on building your perfect game.

## Requirements

- Install `node >= 14` (Consider using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- Install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## Install

Click the link below to create a new repo from the Light Forest template.

> https://github.com/dfdao/lightforest/generate

Or, if you have the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```bash
gh repo create <new-repo-name> --template="dfdao/lightforest"
```

Clone that new repo to your local machine.

## Setting up a round

1. Visit [arena.dfdao.xyz/arena](https://arena.dfdao.xyz/arena) and create a map. Once the map is created, you will get a unique hash of the map's configuration. Copy this value and save it for later.
2. Customize `lightforest.toml`. See [Customization](#customization) for details.
3. Add a `.env` file using the same keys as `.env.example`
4. Run `yarn && yarn start`

Your custom round should be running locally at `localhost:8081`. It should look like this:

Once you're ready to deploy, jump to [Deployment](#deployment) and follow the instructions.

## Customization

To change the client or game rules—like score calculation—you can edit the React components in this repository. To perform deeper modifications, like changing smart contracts or packages, use [darkforest-local](https://github.com/dfdao/darkforest_local). See [Builder's Guide](#builders-guide) for more details about deep customization.

### Round details

`lightforest.toml` provides a fair amount of customizability out of the box.

- Title
- Description
- Org name (e.g. "dfdao")
- Start time
- End time
- Move weight
- Time weight
- Ranks

This repo comes with a pre-populated example:

```toml
[round]
END_TIME = "2022-08-13T00:00:00.000Z"
START_TIME = "2022-07-13T00:00:00.000Z"

DESCRIPTION = "this is an amazing map!"
MOVE_WEIGHT = 1
TIME_WEIGHT = 1
TITLE = "The Amazing Map"
ORG_NAME = "dfdao"

BRONZE_RANK = 180
CONFIG_HASH = '0xfe719a3cfccf2bcfa23f71f0af80a931eda4f4197331828d728b7505a6156930'
GOLD_RANK = 60
SILVER_RANK = 120

```

### Styling

All styles for the round page are defined in `src/Frontend/Styles/lightforest.scss`.
Most elements on the homepage have a data-attribute (starting with `lf-`) that can be used for styling.

For example,

```html
<div lf-map-overview="">...</div>
```

can be styled with the following CSS selector:

```CSS
[lf-map-overview] {
  ...
}
```

The color scheme is also defined in `lightforest.scss` as CSS variables.

## Deployment

The following guides assume you've went through the following checklist before deploying:

### Deployment checklist

- [ ] You've set up the environment variables correctly
- [ ] You're using the correct round parameters in `lightforest.toml`
- [ ] You're configured the visual design to fit the look and feel of your custom round. (`lightforest.scss`)
- [ ] You've changed the favicons and header tags in `index.html`.
- [ ] You've tested the experience locally.

You can use any static site deployment service (Netlify, Vercel, GH Pages, Cloudflare Pages, etc.) to deploy the static site generated by Light Forest. Here's how you would do it with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/):

### Netlify

1. Push your code to your git repository.
2. [Import your site](https://docs.netlify.com/welcome/add-new-site/) into Netlify from your git repository.
3. Make sure the build command is set to `yarn build` and the publish directory to `dist`.
4. Save and deploy
5. Your custom round should be live at something like `https://lightforest-site.netlify.app/ `

### Netlify (CLI)

1. [Install the Netlify CLI](https://cli.netlify.com/).
2. Run `ntl init` to create a new site.
3. Deploy your site with `ntl deploy --prod`.
